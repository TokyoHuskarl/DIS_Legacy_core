Faction: Empire.

　Rtpian Empire.
Also known as the Cugo Empire, referring mainly to the western territories. It was a large empire that ruled the entire continent of Rtpia in ancient times.
Its predecessor was the Grand Alliance of Rtpia, which was created by the union of the human power Republican Cugo, with an oligarchy of senators, and the demihuman tribe (imperials called them "Horned People") Great Kingdom of Coursa, which was linked to the Fiendess Coo.
The Alliance became an empire with the accession to the throne of the human 'Supreme Emperor' Gaius the Grey, under the banner of the Legion, a human fighting force renowned since the Republican era,
From the tundra in the north to the deserts of the south, it conquered approximately all the world the people of Rtpia could conceive of.
The Empire was a multispecies military state that expanded its territory by assimilating and inwardly incorporating the races of the lands it conquered through its mighty military power.

　The Empire boasted an advanced magical civilisation, but even today much of its legacy - the mechanisms of its magical technology - remain unexplained.
Most of the magic of the imperial period was lost during the Dark Ages after its collapse, and there are many things whose existence is only mentioned in legends.

*********************************************************

　The policy of rule that subjected the free peoples of the territories, regardless of race or ethnicity, to equal civil law and order was accepted by the upper classes in the conquered territories, and rule based on cultural assimilation was long and widespread.
Imperial rule was seen as having brought about the co-existence and co-prosperity of many different ethnic groups, and was often over-idealised in later times, when interspecies conflicts were recurrent.

　In reality, however, there was cultural friction between the Cugo civil law and order, which was based on patrilineal societies, and the demihumanic tribes, whose matrilineal societies were originally descended from the fiendess Coo, as well as the conflict between the conqueror Cugos and the conquered Cugos,
The unbridgeable gap between the conquering Cugos and the higher demihuman tribes and the rest of the races,
Recent research has shown that social problems were internalised.
To bring together under one imperial authority a multitude of tribes living in a vast territory and differing in culture, language and even physical form,
The greatest and most powerful empire in the history of mankind has faced enormous difficulties that could not have been solved.

　In the first place, the legal order on which imperial society was based was constituted by human beings on the basis of human values.
In the Empire, human law governed the rights of the various races, and the Senate, made up of representatives of the interests of the various races, eventually became an advisory body to the human 'Princeps", the 'leader of the imperial citizen'.
Even though different races were treated as citizens with the same rights once they had acquired citizenship, the Rtpian Empire was still only a 'human empire'.

*********************************************************

　Although the empire completely dominated the ancient world with internal problems, its downfall began with the occurrence of the disaster known as the demon God Attack.
It is said that the wild and crude tax levies of the late empire also originated from the economic damage caused by the disaster.
What actually happened to the demon attack is shrouded in mystery, with the prevailing theory being that there was a volcanic eruption, as it was difficult to believe that the demon god actually existed.
However, geological investigations in later years revealed that no large-scale volcanic eruptions had taken place, and there have been no particularly strong theories ever since.

　At any rate, this disaster was followed by a drop in temperatures across the continent for the next several hundred years, which led to the collapse of most of the large plantations that were distributed in the north.
The extreme and sudden drop in grain production caused a food crisis on a tremendous scale, and the alleys of the imperial cities were overflowing with people starving to death.
The food crisis was brought to a temporary halt by the end of the 6th century with the development of agricultural technology using magic.
However, the economic damage was incalculable and the empire fell from the peak of its prosperity after this incident.
The grain-growing areas of the south, which had been less affected, literally became the lifeline of the Empire, and the budgetary allocation of the Imperial Army was also tilted towards the south.

　The people of the time feared this rapid cold weather as the 'curse of the demon god', and the incident triggered the spread of various cults with apocalyptic elements.
Among these, the Canaean cults became a strong influence in Rtpian society up to the present day, but will be omitted from this paper.

　Imperial rule may indeed have brought prosperity to the regions.
There may have been long periods of 'PAX IMPERIA', when the tribes of the region were not at each other's throats.
For those who lived through the imperial period, the 'light of civilisation' may well have been the 'light of imperial cities'.

　All those benefits were realised through the invocation of the violent apparatus of the imperial army and its thorough exploitation of the conquered.
The economy of the empire was in effect supported by the labour of war slaves,
In order to sustain the structure of the 'Rtpian Empire', it had no choice but to continue its wars of aggression, always with some external enemy.
In the end, the empire was only made up of a tremendous deprivation and enormous consumption, relying on military power.

　When it finally brought all others outside the region to their knees, the Empire was faced with a contradiction that could no longer be solved by military power:
What are we to take from now that we have taken from everyone?

*********************************************************

　After a violent civil war, the empire split into East and West, with the Western Empire, which remained the Empire of Man, falling to the chaos created by financial ruin, pestilence epidemics and foreign invasions.
The Eastern Empire, which had become the empire of the demihumans, was weakened by repeated pressure from foreign enemies from the north, south, east and west,
It gradually reverted to a demihuman feudal society with the monarch - Basileus - as king of the kings at the top.

　The civil law and order of the empire was completely lost, and the regions that once constituted the empire were now occupied by various kingdoms founded by various tribes.
The imperial giant finally collapsed, and on its remains a medieval Rtpia was established, with the Potetons' Orsach Kingdom and the demihuman Kingdoms of the demihuman Tribe as its two main actors.

  I don't think I need to mention it, but the model is almost exactly the Roman Empire.
However, the producer is Japanese, so there may be some components of the Chinese Empire in the way it is depicted.
In the LEGACY additions, the image of the Western superpowers in the modern era is also very much overlapping.
  The reason the term Rtpian Empire is not often used in the game is that no other empires are recognised in the world of the period.
It is possible that other great powers exist outside the continent, but at least they are the strongest and largest power in the period under construction.
The social structure of the Empire is described with a bit too much emphasis on its reliance on the military, but think of this as the game's cottage-villain power flavour.

　The standard of social science in the empire remains at the level of classical antiquity, for better or worse.
Slavery is a prime example.
Technologies of summoning magical minions that would be rediscovered and put to practical use more than a thousand years later were fully feasible during the imperial period.
However, they were neglected during the imperial period due to the social structure.
It was a technology that was abandoned because it was possible to buy slaves who could use magic without having to go to the trouble of creating and using embodiments.

　On the other hand, even during the peak of the technological decline, there are places here and there where the technology is more advanced than in the modern age in which we live.
It's like a player state after a hegemonic victory in a strategy game, advancing only military technology and ignoring other elements.
In the end, they will face a terrible catastrophe at the end of their too distorted development.

*********************************************************

　For the characters of the world in which they are created, whether they are contemporaries or posterity, they are such a big part of the world that we cannot help but have a certain awe of them.
From the perspective of us higher-ups, though, if we were to make "muh strongest military force" as much as we wanted, and colour in all the areas we could walk to,

　As mentioned above, the ruling structure of the empire is full of terrible contradictions, and it is also true that it was meant to crumble.
However, the most peaceful time in the world was, for better or worse, when this empire existed.
After that, it was just a hell of interspecies hatred, which continued until the end of the world.
In such a world, fantastical monster races are randomly brought into the inner circle, while the war outside the region continues unceasingly,
It is rather astonishing that the imperial order survived for hundreds of years (well, like Rome in historical times, there were probably crises such as civil wars).
Behind the scenes, there was probably a tremendous effort by various parties to preserve the 'PAX IMPERIA' and bequeath better times to future generations.

　The sentient races of this world reached a kind of catastrophic goal when they collapsed in the worst possible way the order of the Rtpian Empire, which was once completed,
The rest may just be a medieval fantasy-style world reenactment of something we've seen somewhere else, dying out in a constant repetition.

*********************************************************

　Originally, this game was developed as a sequel to the old version, and if the sequel had taken shape, the protagonist force would have been the Empire.
The perspective was shifted to the Imperial side, and the story was to be about people struggling to maintain order as the old world crumbled, starting with the southward expansion of the dragon tribes.
In the end, real-life circumstances prevented me from having the time to work on it, so I ended up writing a lot of stuff related to the Empire that I had saved up over the past two years in flavour texts and setting materials as an additional force.
To be honest, most of the Empire-related descriptions have become the author's glimpses.

　If you have read enough of this material to this point, you may enjoy playing this game more if you realise that the real protagonist is the Rtpian Empire, not the Dragon Tribe or Orthunass.
