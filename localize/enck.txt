Objectives:^Destroy the Imperial City Senate in Niosia City, and then have Orthunass enter the ruins of it:^The hints for this map are extensive,^right-click to change the page.

Hint 1:^・The Imperial Army is weakened beyond comparison to before. If you're careful with the superior Imperial artillery, you shouldn't struggle in the early battle.^Especially the Imperial Border Guard - Limitanei - trying to prevent our river crossing, mainly consisting of irregular troops, is not a formidable opponent.^With careful movement and quick action, they shouldn't take long to deal with.^^・However, even if things go perfectly, a confrontation with the stationed Imperial IV Legion is inevitable.^The Legion, known as the strongest combat unit in the world, is incredibly powerful, even now in its weakened state.^There's no specific tactic that works well against the legionaries; you must face them head-on.^Always try to maintain numerical superiority against units named "Imperial Legion"^Otherwise, your army may end up facing disastrous consequences.

Hint 2:^・You can hire Northmen mercenaries from the ship at the landing site on this map.^Northmen soldiers join as initial forces, and they are a powerful asset that must be used effectively.^^・The Empire continues to weaken and even shows signs of splitting.^Their army is in the midst of downsizing due to financial issues.^The Legion - Legio - that Otonas feared cannot maintain its equipment,^and there's little coordination with newly established units.^A lightning-fast invasion can easily eliminate enemies outside the walls.^But, \c[5]still, the Empire is a formidable force compared to us.^Never allow a protracted battle.\c[0] Wasting time will not only allow local forces to regroup^but may also face formidable foes like the Imperial Mobile Field Army - Comitatenses - dispatched from the center or south,^or the Imperial Subjugated Army - Auxilia - from the east.
Hint 3:^・There's a village of Potetons in the northwest.^The Imperial Legion is stationed there, but they're unprepared for your force's surprise landing, and initial defense is thin.^The Potetons have long been oppressed by the Empire; their cooperation may be possible if the Imperial forces are eliminated.^There seems to be a small gold mine in the forest near the village.^^・To the east is the famous Niosia gold mine.^If it can be captured, you won't run out of gold or stone.^But even in this age, the mine is always defended by the Imperial Legion.^As stated repeatedly, the Imperial Legion, though reticent, is extremely powerful,^so half-hearted attempts to capture it should not be made.
Hint 4:^・The Empyrean Lord, Orthunass can summon Drago Naskarls nearby with the R skill.^She can even send Naskarl over a thin wall.^Orthunass is a powerful wizard unit, and with enough SP, she can handle small forces single-handly.^Besides, she automatically buffs nearby dragon units.^ However, her combat ability is not too great to deal with anything.^The Empire recognizes the existence of the Empyrean Lord, leader of the dragons,^and will attack her relentlessly to hunt her down.^Letting her support troops is effective, but sending her to the front lines carries great risk, as her defeat is a condition for losing the game.^^・JOMSHERSIR is an incredibly strong unit, even when allied.^There's no penalty for him being defeated, but losing him carelessly will surely set back victory.^^・Enemy powerful wizards and flag bearers should be prioritized for removal with archers or catapults.^Especially the flag bearers, whose presence can significantly change the enemy's combat ability.
