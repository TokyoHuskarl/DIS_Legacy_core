Core part of DIS:Legacy. Simply speaking, it's an insanely complicated spaghetti.  
Readablitiy is utter shite.

Header files for DraCore. macabre.  
### NsLib  
Nasun Library.  
The aim of this was to make up useful TPC command Library that can be introduced into any RM2003MP project.  
But the developement is stuck and unorganized for other projects than DIS.  
## Java Script Sources
