Welcome to DIS: Legacy!^This control tutorial will explain the basic RTS controls^and give a simple explanation of the combat system.
In this game, the economy, production, and combat all progress in real time.^Don't worry, you can pause the game at any time^using the [V] key/button in the upper right corner.
This explanation will also progress almost automatically,^but since it won't progress while the game is paused,^if it takes you a long time to understand,^please try pausing the game.
First, let's select the red unit you see on the screen. ^Unit selection can be done by dragging with the left click.
Unit selected! ^The names and statuses of the selected units will be displayed on the monitor below. ^Each unit has its own individual status, equipment, and skills.^But for now, let's learn how to move your units.
Let's move the unit. ^To move a unit, right-click on where you want it to go. ^Try moving the "Dragon Knight" to the place ^where the two pillars are standing. *
Movement complete! ^This title also implements (weak-minded) path-finding, but considering the ^operation response (a big lie), if you specify a location directly,^the unit will go straight there.
If the ^unit hits a wall or is directed to move on the ^mini-map (bottom right), it will move using pathfinding.
\Let's go through the winding passageway at the end of the path. ^(There are almost no such passages in the main story.) ^Manual routing is also possible by holding down the ^Shift key and right-clicking.
There's a new group of units ahead! ^In this game, you will rarely control a single unit, but will often be managing ^multiple units together.
Units of the same type, or units assigned to the same group ^as described below, can be selected en masse with a double-click.^Let's batch-select the ^\c[5]those purple units.
When you move multiple units, they will ^basically try to form a horizontal column formation. ^The direction of the column can be specified by moving the ^mouse while right-clicking and dragging.
You can also adjust the thickness of the ^columns by moving the mouse wheel while dragging. ^By the way, you can follow the ^camera to the selected unit by pressing the [Space] key.
Finally, let's make an attack on an enemy unit. ^The attack designation is done by right-clicking. ^Select the \c[5]friendly unit and right-click on the ^fence at the bottom.
Now you can get through! You will need to give instructions if you want to destroy ^walls and fences, as they will move to ignore them as much as possible ^unless they obstruct your path.
However, in most cases, military units will fight nearby enemies on their own,^ so you only need to give them instructions on where to move without having to operate them every single time. ^(It is also true that it is better to give detailed order if possible.)
In the right-click-only movement we have done so far, priority is given to going to the ^directed position. If you encounter an enemy along the way, you will either pass through without moving or move while being attacked.
Then, you can use [Alt+Right Click] or [X] key to give battle priority to the move instruction.^ (This is called an attack move instruction.) ^After a few seconds, weak enemy soldiers will appear, so let them fight ^by giving the \c[5]attack move instruction.
As you can see, the hominescums are nothing to Dragons. ^As you may have noticed in the attacks so far, ^some units have skills, and they fight by activating them on their own during the battle.
Of course, you can also manually instruct them to use their skills. ^You can see the details of each skill by hovering the cursor over the QWER button in the lower left corner of the screen.
If you do not want the player to use a skill without your permission,^ you can switch to manual operation mode by pressing the [F] button in the lower left corner or the [F] key.^ Each ASDF mode change has its own special features, which are described below.
When a skill is manually activated, it will ^basically aim at the cursor location. ^Here, let's use the "Dragon Knight's" W-skill "Fireball"^ to take down the person who appears on the left side away from you.
Crispy. ^In addition to the active skills we just practiced, some units have ^passive skills that automatically activate their effects.
When you select either the ^Dragon Knight or the ^Militia Dragon,^ move your ^cursor over the rainbow-colored feather that appears in the lower-left frame.
Units with a culture of affiliation belong to the "Celestial Army". Units in the "Celestial Army" will automatically recover their HP. ^There are other passive effects as well.
Here, look at the passive of the "Dragon Knight". ^It should say "Tactic: Shield Wall Directive Available". ^A unit with a shield, unless it is a cavalryman,^ can hold its shield and prepare for enemy attacks.
So how can you give a tactical instruction? ^Press the bottom-left \c[5] button or the [S] key to give the "Directive: Defend". \c[0]^A unit that is capable of shield wall instructions will deploy a shield wall with ^"Instructions: Defend".
Units in a shield wall will have their defensive capabilities ^visibly increased, but will not be able to use their attack skills. ^Other units are also capable of ^"pike wall instructions," a long spear version of the ^"shield wall instruction," from the defense instruction.
Hover over the shield symbol that appears above the state. ^It might still not make sense regarding the detailed parameters. ^For now, as it is written, try ^"Instruction "Vigilance" to dissolve the shield wall.
Thus, units with tactical instructions can switch ^tactics with ^"Instructions: Vigilance" or "Instructions: Defense".
If you hold down the Alt key and press ASDF, you can change only the ^mode of action without giving ^tactical instructions. ^
In addition to defense, many of the archers can perform ^"scatter combat," which automatically draws fire by ^"Instructions: Vigilance". Since ^ archers will appear in the future, you may want to ^ try this.
Also, the red circle that appears when you hold down the Alt key ^represents the normal attack range of each unit. Please select ^archers and check them together.
As you may have already noticed, each unit has a field of view, and you cannot see what is going on where the unit is not visible. It is sometimes necessary to send out scouts to secure visibility.
The newly emerged "elf longbowmen" have a wide field of vision, and ^they should be able to see the enemy in the distance on the right side. Let's shoot and kill them.
Those with shields were ^a little harder to defeat than those with spears. ^In this way, units with shields are stronger against arrow bullets.
Shields in this work are not damage reduction equipment, but function as a bottom-up ^attack evasion value (EVA). The ^higher shield holders can hold out for an extremely long time. Even more so if ^shield walls are deployed.
It may sound quite developmental, but ^attacking from behind weakens the effectiveness of shields. If you can attract them with shield soldiers and then attack from the ^side rear with cavalry or archers, it will be easier to break them.
Double-handed soldiers are not only vulnerable to arrows. The spearmen you just defeated have a damage bonus against cavalrymen. ^Other than that, some of them are capable of ranged attacks and have high firepower in various ways.
There are other affinities for each type of soldier, but since ^Dora and his men are the best race in the world, you don't need to worry too much about them as long as you use ^Dora and his men.
The explanation is getting longer and longer, ^and you must be getting tired of it. I am tired too. Unfortunately, ^we are going to start explaining the parameters from here.
If you want to pause and take a break, you can open the menu by pressing the [Esc] key or the X in the upper right corner, in addition to pausing. You can save and load at any time. You can also adjust volume, mouse and camera sensitivity.
A new unit has been launched in another location. ^You might have used to move the camera by moving the mouse, but it's tedious to scroll far away every time. ^Then, please left-click on the mini-map in the lower left corner.
I think you have finished moving the camera safely by now. ^Not only the camera, but also the movement of units can be directed from the ^mini-map. ^Attack moves are also possible, of course.
Please select "the sister of the brave" who is only one unit. Compared to the "Dragon Knight," ^she has lower AR and AP, and extremely high ^HIT, EVA, and WILL. ^What do these mean?
As I mentioned earlier, EVA represents the "evasion rate. ^HIT represents the "hit rate" of weapon attacks. ^In other words, she has high hit and evasion.
The low AR, on the other hand, represents the armor the unit has. ^In short, it is "defensive power. ^is removed with each attack in this work. ^AP is "magic power" and is directly related to the power of magic.
MR is "magic resistance," or magic defense, but you will almost never have to worry about it. ^Taken all together, this "brave sister" is a ^lightly-armed swordsman who fights while avoiding attacks.
WILL is strength of will and resistance against mental attacks. ^The higher it is, the less likely it is to be demoralized. ^By the way, you can see the unit's ability in detail with the [I] key.
The units that appear in the game also have various other characteristics. ^If you are interested in them, you should check them by pressing the [I] key. ^It is perfectly acceptable to skip this section without checking.
Each unit has a different role, so it would be uncomfortable to move them ^together. Then, by pressing [Ctrl+[number keys]], you can assign a number to the ^unit.
Once assigned, they will appear on the right, and you can ^select each group by pressing the ^corresponding number key or by right-clicking on the display. You may register each of the ^four people in front of you.
Oh, I'm tired. Let's put together the ^groups of units that have appeared and go ahead and defeat the enemy. ^\c[17]You may want to save here just in case. ^\c[0]If you get hit ahead, it means you have to load.
You have annihilated the enemy! Congratulations! ^This concludes the explanation of basic operations and specifications. ^Thanks for your hard work.
H-how dare you!
