One of the strongest infantry unit in the game. ^They can also attack even at long range with their throwing axe. ^...JOMSVIKING was the most powerful mercenary group of the northerners, ^and has terrorized even the Dragons.^ On the other hand, they offered their axes for anyone who would provide them with a place to battle. ^Some of them even joined the ranks of the Dragons during the southward advance of the Orthunass' Army.
A long spear infantry specialized in anti-cavalry.^ Their armor was simple cloth armor, so they were quite vulnerable.
A shock cavalry specialized in charge with his two-handed lance.^...On the battlefield where cataphracts could not arrive in time, they, as lightly armed cavalrymen, deployed as cheaper shock power.^ The cavalry charge with double-handed kontos showed tremendous impact power.^But on the other hand, the Contarii were vulnerable against any incoming attack and the casualty rate of them was significantly high.

An mediocre spearman. Cheap and strong against cavalry. ^...Spear mercenaries of the Potetons, a human tribe under Imperial servitude. ^As a result of secret contact with the Potetons by the Dragonic Envoy who approached the Potetons to offer their forces, ^a cheap mercenary contract was concluded under special conditions. ^One of the conditions were to support them for a future uprising against the Empire. ^ Well of course, the Dragons were unwilling to fulfill such an obligation.
An ordinary crossbowman. ^Unlike archers, crossbowmen do not kite opponents in skirmish mode, but their bolts deal more damage than arrows.
A random man with a spear. ^Very weak.

The best horse archer in this game. Strong against cavalry. Very expensive. ^Still, if you control them well, they will work more than his cost. ^...The Envoy of the Dragons pleaded with the demonic nobles in the eastern part of the Empire to sell their slave warriors to Dragons. ^They are respected even by the gens Drana, which respects military arts, despite the fact that they are humans.^They have been trained in combat and mounted archery since their childhood, and their prowess is no mean feat.
A basic worker dragon who produces resources. Since they fly in the sky, they are not affected by any terrain. ^...The dragons of the gens Nasun have a monopoly on production technology. ^They are not very good at constructing buildings, but very good at producing resources.

A random guy with a mere wooden stick. Very weak.
A human mercenary with a spear. They are cheap and strong against cavalry. ^Surprisingly, the Dragons often uses humans as soldiers. ^Because human life is unimportant to Dragons,^they use these poor hominescums as expendable cannon fodders.

The one and original berserker. Strong against infantry and automatically regenerates his HP.^ Many players may have been beaten by him in endurance mode.^But if once they are on your side, they can be very reliable ally. ^Because they are half-naked, they are vulnerable to ranged weapons.
A trained archer of the north. ^They are not so great archers, but their strength is that they are sober and sturdy.
A siege weapon that fires bolts that hit through. ^So-called mobile ballista. This is also an imitation of imperial siege weapon. ^... Originally, Dragons had taken these mechanical weapons lightly. However, in a recent skirmish against the Empire, ^that perception was overturned at the cost of blood when they were hit by a volley of magically enchanted Scorpions.
A goblin levy with a short bow.^...The goblins are more dexterous than most of other races.^That is why only a mere short-term training makes them good at archery.^However, they lack physical power unlike orks, and few could draw a powerful bow.
An orc with a simple hatchet.^...Phrases like "If you survive, women captives will be yours!" attract them to join imperial ranks.^But basically most of those levies get wasted as cannon fodders in the battle field.^ Orcs are closely related to the valiant greenskin orks that inhabit the Far East.^and although they are of good physique, many of them have personalities not suited for fighting.

*A super-heavy cavalry that tramples everything in its path with two-handed Kontos charge.^ There is no way in this game to stop cataphracts' charge with a full complement of numbers.^But, due to lacking shield, they will be quickly worn out by repeated, reckless frontal assaults.^...In the late antiquity, the cataphracts of the Imperial Comitatenses were organized as decisive units. ^ In reality, however, they tended to be used as *fire-fighting units* to deal with the continuing collapse of defensive lines, rather than for their original purpose of inflicting decisive blows on the enemy. ^Their missions were more flexible and varied than we in the modern age might imagine. ^In other words, they were like an anachronistic armored combat unit that fought to prolong the imperial order in the age of collapse. ^Historical documents indicate that for every single cataphract, a simple transmitter and receiver for the new technology of magical communication that appeared at the end of the empire was deployed. It is astonishing that at the end of antiquity, information links were being established within the troops.
An inexpensive archer.^Better than nothing.^...Dragons often forced abducted humans to carry short bows.
*An elven mercenary archer that has quite long range. ^Has Very high cost, but as archers they are unrivaled. ^...Once upon a time, even dragons had admitted elven skill of the archery... ^Well that was a story from a long time ago. ^They are now banned from the Dragons because they were found to be using arrows smeared with excrement. ^Now everyone knows how filthy creatures elves are.
A dragon of the gens Nasun, who took up a weapon to protect the fields. It has a high attack power for its cost, but it is relatively fragile.^Just because they are underestimating how battles can be fierce.
A dragon who likes taking a walk. He was once gentle and powerful. ^...And suffers from Depression every day because of his gentleness. ^He can be a good cannon fodder, though his offensive ability is very limited.
A powerful melee soldier, although its cost is relatively high.^Strong against archers. ^And beware of spears, as they are treated as cavalry.^It will become more powerful when the Dragonic civilization enters into the age of the empire. ^...They are professional soldiers from the gens Drana. ^Other than combat, they can only play in the sun.
The strongest dragonic melee unit. ^They are also treated as cavalry, so be careful with spears. ^...A guard unit that protects the leader of the Dragons: Orthunass. ^Only the most elite of the volunteer dragons of the gens Nasun are recruited and trained as Naskarl.
An Archer who handle crossbow with high one-shot power. ^Be careful of using gold. ^They're also highly mobile as they fly in the sky. ^...Some members of the gens Draco who stayed on the island used their natural dexterity ^to create and equip weapons circulating on the continent, relying on hearsay. ^It is said that thier crossbow sometimes explodes and hurts those Dragons. ^How poor.
A dragon that breathes scorching breath that has AoE effect. ^Because they don't want to get scorched themselves, they try to keep his distance from enemies. ^In such a case, they should try flying, but they somehow just walk. ^Because they hate flying due to overweight. How dragonic.
A dragonic worker unit who specializes in construction. ^Since they fly in the sky, they're not affected by the terrain.
A cute dragon maid that heals units around them.^...Even after the threat of the dragons became apparent with the southward advance of the Orthunass' Army, ^those of the gens Draco continued to be heavily employed as housekeepers in the empire.^ The imperials have become so corrupt that the time of their downfall is near.
A siege weapon that shoots a long-range, high-intensity, ranged attack. So-called mangonel. ^They are devastatingly powerful against densely-packed enemy units.^However, they are difficult to handle because they can damage allies as well.^If you want to use it effectively, you may need to consider the composition of your army.
A dragon knight that specializes in shock power.^ They are strong against cavalry.^Although their defensive parameter is slightly worse, their assault power is incredible.^If you deploy a large number of them to rush into a battle,^you will gain an obvious advantage.
An autonomous stone statues imbued with magical power.^If only you don't mind spending stones, it can be said that its cost is very cheap. ^They have a good amount of AR, besides their strong against ranged attack due to its attribution. ^However, they are incredibly weak against magic.^...The sculptors of the gens Draco painstakingly carve each piece of stone by hand to create its shape.
A siege weapon used to smash down castle gates. ^...It is tremendously effective against buildings, but is of little use for anything else.
A draconic wizard who fires a barrage of magic missile; be careful not to run out of MP.^...A dragon of the gens Draco who studied magic in the empire. ^They studied diligently, but because they lacked talent, they couldn't master any magic than magic missile. ^Still, J'Drago will *make it big. ^There is no doubt about it.
A dragon knight who deals magic damage. ^They are strong against infantry. ^...A dragon of the gens Drana who studied magic in the Empire. ^She was too stupid to master magic, ^but she knew how to beat people down with a staff very well instead.
An elite wizard dragon who can cast many kinds of powerful magic.^She is insanely powerful, but also insanely expensive.^Well that's because she has an exellent global elite career and degrees from an imperial elite academy. ^Only when you select the Orthunass's army, her cost is 10% off, thanks to, well, Orthunass' connections.^...A dragon of the gens Nasun who studied magic in the empire.^She often complains like this: ^"There are public baths and good wine in the Empire, but ^this island is so awfully backward.^But those ignorant "civis" are still happy to have statues like this.^ It's a terribly rackward, it's really embarrassing."^ almost every day.
A dragon of the gens Nasun who has the awareness of being a soldier. ^All they have done is just changing their leather cap to an iron helmet.^So they haven't become that hard-hit.^Never expect something wise from those lizard brain.  
A dragon who has awakened to the way of Bushido. Its attack speed is quite fast. ^...They love the phrase "Bushido means to die." ^But they don't actually fight in the honourable code. ^Even if you ask them to commit seppuku, they will just respond, "What? How come must I do that?"^How shamefurr.


A Northern shield infantry. ^Overally stronger than regular human infantry of the same tier.
A Poteton human warrior who is very strong against ranged weapon. ^They can be trained unbelievably fast, but they are not very offensive choice.^...In the chaos of the Niosia Peninsula after the Orthunass' Army's invasion, ^many of the free Potetons, both men and women, picked up swords and began to fight. ^ Certain amount of them were mere marauders, and as they scattered throughout the continent as mercenaries or "adventurers", ^the chaos of the Rtpian continental world was deepened further. ^ It is said that the name Huscarl originated with the Orthunass' bodyguard or with the Warriors of the Nords.
The warrior chief of the JOMSVIKING and the strongest infantryman in the game. ^...Even after the collapse of the Empire, which was followed by the southward expansion of the Dragons,^ the eastern-west division of the empire, and the invasion of the Great Nordic Army,^these vikings remained somewhat powerful as an independent faction.^ However, in an era without a hegemonic power, they were naturally regarded as a danger because they were an independent force with just military power.^ Even the strongest warrior group could not afford to make enemies of all the major powers on the continent at once.^So Freya's chariots galloped, and the berserkers of the north finally fell into the sea beyond the northern shore.
A Mercenary on horseback. ^Better than no cavalry units at least.
Cavalrymen of the northerners. They always go out with javelins. ^They are not very strong in fistfights.
A great raven with magical powers used by the northerners. ^They are extremely weak, but they are quick and have magic attacks with fast intervals between shots.
A more powerful raven than the one that sails from the center of the town. Note that it is still vulnerable to fire.
A sword soldier with a strength befitting the end of the militia tree. ^She wears heavy armor and a hounskull helm, and wields a huge two-handed sword by the muscular strength of a dragon. ^They are all very powerful, but they don't look like dragons. ^This is why they are not very popular among their own kind. ^They are very concerned about the fact that they are the only ones who are out of sync with the era in which they were modeled.
A veteran sword infantry of the Nords. ^ They're moderately skilled swordsmen, but less powerful than Dragonic warriors such as Naskarl and Dragon Knights. ^However, they're definitely stronger than mere lizards with weapon like Mushagon.

Weapons to break down even more improved castle gates. It is no exaggeration to say that it was added only to torment ^players.

A siege weapon that fires bolts that hit through. ^The so-called mobile ballista. ^It is more modest than a catapult, but its projectile firepower is high enough.
Elite goblin archers belonging to the Imperial Support Forces. ^They have a vigorous morale for goblins. ^ ...They played a role similar to that of a commando unit in the modern army, ^ performing missions that no other race could perform, such as not only scattering troops during battles, but also ambushing and even infiltrating the enemy's rear. ^ Among the support forces, the special task force called "extraordinarii" ^ consisted of soldiers who were as well trained as the regular army, and many of them continued to fight for the empire with pride as professional soldiers.
An ordinary shield soldier in the Imperial Frontier Defense Corps. ^...After the legion, the standing garrison army, was reduced due to disarmament, ^the defense of frontier areas was entrusted to the Frontier Defense Corps, consisting of different races and local people. Their role was to delay combat until the arrival of mobile field forces, or in other words, to buy time. ^ For a while after the military reforms, they did well in their frontier security duties, but in the upheavals that followed the southward movement of the Celestial Army, they found themselves in a difficult situation due to their lack of skill and equipment.
A siege weapon that conducts high-firepower ranged attacks from a long distance. ^They are devastatingly powerful against densely-packed enemy units,...... but are difficult to handle because ^they also engulf allies. ^If you want to operate it, you may need to consider the composition of your army. ^It has an anti-building bonus even if the research of "siege attack technology" is not completed.

A high-mobility golem made with lots of stones. ^It is hard and fast, but there is something subtle about it. ^...In its heyday, the Empire operated autonomous golems, and in later times the technology was preserved in detail in the eastern regions. ^ However, the golems operated by the imperial army in this period were operated by goblins who rode inside and piloted the golem due to the need to cut ^costs. ^ When destroyed, the goblins inside were worse than mincemeat.
Shield soldiers from the Poteetonian tribe on the imperial side, who were reasonably well equipped and well trained. ^They always went into battle with a lightweight throwing spear called pulumbata. ^...In late antiquity, when the Imperials began to avoid serving as a single soldier, ^much of the military service was carried out by Poteteons of different or poorer origins. The Potetonians were by no means a monolithic people, and even after the uprising of the Potetonian rebels, there were some who sided with the Empire. Many of the "imperial soldiers" with whom the Poteetonian rebels fought were not imperialists themselves, but rather subhumans and Poteetonians who were supposed to be their fellow citizens and were in a weak position in imperial society.
Abandoned by society, they are invincible dragons with nothing left to lose. ^He has been imprisoned in a temple because of various recent incidents that have made him unfashionable. ^His very existence is like the worst joke. ^ In fact, if you wanted to use it, it might be quite useful as something like an war elephant.






The Potatoes, a powerful tribe of people who joined the rebel army in search of freedom. Unable to maintain their horses due to heavy taxes imposed by the empire, they fight on dismounted horses. They are able to maintain their weapons and armor on their own, so their costs are kept low compared to their abilities. They do not have the advanced equipment of the imperial army, nor do they have the faith of the northerners, who are more frenzied in their struggles. They have only a simple set of knightly equipment, the will to fight for freedom, and pride, but that is more than enough to be a waste stone for the dragon tribe.
Human workers. ^Anything but combat can be done to a certain extent.

A degraded version of Dragonaskarl. ^No more, no less. ^ Although they're degraded version of Dragonic elite troop, ^still they can be surprisingly useful if the cataphracts are not ready in time.
A wizard who can unleash a wide range of destructive magic and also perform healing role. ^...The Imperial Legion employed sorcerers as regular soldiers.^But by the time of the southward advance of the Orthunass' Army, ^the number of sorcerers actually serving in the army was considerably reduced.
A scout of the Harpy tribe, rich in mobility. ^...not suited for direct combat. ^...As a winged race, the Harpies had excellent eyesight and were welcomed as excellent scouts by all forces. ^They continued to serve as scouts in later generations.
A Minotaur soldier crushing an enemy with a two-handed hammer. ^Their firepower alone is tremendous. ^But they are slow in movement and attack, and since they do not wear armor, they will kill a dog if handled carelessly. ^He's a bull.





A general-purpose humanoid decisive weapon. ^...now the old Altipia, the steel fist impelling the heavens^ to defeat the deformed demon god, light the fire with your resources! ^I don't have any particular achievements or anything like that when I worked so hard to get them out.

An elite light cavalry of the Imperial Army.^ They are capable of rivaling the heavy cavalry of other armies.
An imperial cavalry archer. ^ They are heavily armed as cavalry, but they do not have the technique of Parthian shot.^So they cannot use the skirmish tactics.^ Use them as a solid bowman with high mobility.
The Imperial Guard's light cavalry. They may have weapons capable of ranged attacks.
Imperial Guard guardsmen. ^It is a purely reinforced version of the rank-and-file soldier. ^But the timing of production makes it difficult to determine whether they can play an active role or not.
Shield soldiers who are in the front line of the Mobile Field Army's infantry battle line. ^ Since it has a movement speed buff when not in combat, it can be deployed quickly. ^...Much of the advanced magical technology that once made the Imperial Army the world's strongest fighting force has been lost in this era, and their equipment, though of high quality, is not particularly special. ^However, they were still composed of professional soldiers and were still a uniquely highly disciplined fighting force.
The long-saddled soldier is the rear line of the Mobile Field Army's infantry battle line. ^ In defense, they use their reach to catch cavalry and other races' assaults, and in attack, they are responsible for cleaving the enemy from behind the line of battle. ^ They can deploy quickly because of their movement speed buff during non-combat. ^ ...Their weapon of choice, the menaurion, is a weapon between a spear and a sword, a sort of naginata, and requires considerable skill to handle well.
Archers in the Imperial Army. ^...After the military reforms, the overly powerful mechanical projectile weapons were reevaluated in order to reduce costs, and ^simple bows and arrows were often used. The training of the most skilled archers naturally took time, and it became difficult to fill the required number of marksmen. In this era, human archers often came from impoverished rural villages.
The elite archers of the Imperial Army. ^...For the simple reason that many of them were from the East,^ synthetic bows were preferred among the skilled Imperial Army archers for both their rapid-firing ability and power.
New recruits of the human species belonging to the Imperial Army. ^ They always go into battle with a lightweight throwing spear called a pulumbata. ^ In the Eastern Imperial Army, human volunteer soldiers were basically trained as regular Imperial soldiers and were given rations of equipment, but ^ even new recruits who had just served in the army did not receive regular equipment. ^The Imperial military administration was exhausted and in disarray due to the war in the south, and ^sometimes human kind soldiers who should have been assigned to the regular army were assigned to the support army. Such unlucky soldiers were usually defeated along with the demons in the support forces, or worse, they would disappear as dewdrops on the battlefield.
Light infantry troops can handle everything from scatter combat to white combat to some extent. ^They always go out with a lightweight throwing spear called pulumbata. ^... The situation in which the Empire needed the regular army to go into battle was, in the end, a difficult situation that could not be supported by the support forces of the demon tribe. The regular army was always forced to fight against the enemy with a small number of troops. Although their equipment was light, they worked well as a small and agile infantry unit and supported the combat operations of the imperial army.

A mediocre shield soldier. ^Nothing but mediocre.
A mediocre but better shield soldier. ^The strength is their cost to train. ^...Soldiers in the service of the Poteton nobles had the custom of painting their armor blue, and this became a tradition that continued long into later generations. To counter the superior metal armor of the Empire, striking weapons were especially favored by the rebel infantry.
Archers using powerful crossbows. Unlike archers, crossbowmen do not fire in scatter mode, but they have superior power and accuracy. ^The insurgents may have a considerable advantage over other forces in projectile battles because of their numbers.
Female amphibious soldiers who can slice light soldiers into pieces. ^ Cheap, fast, and fragile. ^ ...In late antique Altipia, where order and security under imperial authority collapsed simultaneously, ^ the need arose to prepare for sporadic and small-scale encounters and raids. ^ Perhaps because of this, or perhaps due to the influence of the matriarchal culture of the demons, ^ at any rate, in late antiquity, women of the human species began to appear who, like them, ^ became warriors.
As the name suggests, they were light cavalrymen with excellent combat skills. Although they appear to be mediocre, their performance is considerably superior to other units of the same rank.
A cavalryman with a two-handed lance that specializes in assault capability, as the name suggests. ^...The Poteaton rebels, who had captured the imperial Kontos, confronted the imperial cavalry by imitating ^the imperial contry cavalry as they were.
Flag bearers of the Imperial regular army. ^It gives the buff effect "inspiration" to surrounding friendly units just by being there. ^In addition to being a buff, "Inspiration" also has the ability to restore defeat when it is granted. It is an essential unit for VERY HARD or higher.
A medic with a certain level of combat ability. ^But it is best not to hope for more than minimal self-defense.
A common squid with something that could be a weapon. Very weak. They are in need of food, so if you give them food, they will fight for you.

Poachers in that area with short bows. ^Better than no shooting power.
A savage with a scythe. ^They are destroyed in an instant when hit by a shot, but they have moderate instantaneous firepower. All you have to do is to charge! ^When upgraded, they revert back to pikemen.
He is a recovering soldier with the combat ability of an infantryman. Thanks to his ^Perk, he is harder than he looks and can support the front line.
A normal magician. ^He is between Tier 1 and Tier 2 magician of other forces.
He is a great wizard of the Potatoes who can use many kinds of magic. ^He is more of a firepower specialist.
He has a banner that gives the buff effect "Koudou" to surrounding friendly units just by being there. ^The "Koumai" not only has a buff effect, but also has the ability to restore defeat when it is granted. ^An essential unit for VERY HARD or higher.
A light goblin scatterer with a small footprint. ^Hard to be attacked by projectiles. ^...In the Imperial Army, many Goblin tribesmen participated in combat as scatterers. ^Their small size and dexterity gave them an advantage in projectile warfare, and they supported the Empire's combat as a small, maneuverable force. The small size of the Goblin soldiers meant, on the other hand, that they were inferior in stature. ^ They were sometimes deployed in hand-to-hand combat beyond their original role, but the results were usually disastrous.
Goblin light cavalrymen with tremendous speed. ^...Goblins mounted on wolves served as support soldiers for the empire, mainly in reconnaissance missions and flanking attacks.
Goblin light infantry with long spears. ^...Although not strong enough to stop cavalrymen, they are highly mobile. ^...Some of the goblins were formed as long spear-bearers to intercept charging cavalry and dragon tribes. ^However, they were not expected to actually stop the charge, ^in essence, they were only damage-causing personnel to be trampled. ^ In the late empire, the lives of support soldiers were often taken lightly. ^Of course, even in ancient times the death of an individual was a tragedy. ^But for the Imperials, the death of a group of support soldiers without citizenship meant nothing more than a statistical figure.
The small, light goblin scatterers. ^They are less susceptible to attack by projectiles. ^...In the Imperial Army, many Goblin tribesmen participated in combat as scatterers. ^Their small size and dexterity gave them an advantage in projectile warfare, and they supported the Empire's combat as a small, maneuverable force. The small size of the Goblin soldiers meant, on the other hand, that they were inferior in stature. ^ Beyond their original role, they were sometimes deployed in hand-to-hand combat, but the results were usually disastrous.
Goblins with longbows in their hands. ^They are quite fierce for goblins, and are able to fight with archers of other forces at least on equal terms. Moreover, he can even engage in melee combat by switching weapons.
A goblin with a crossbow. ^Each shot is low in power, but that doesn't matter if you set up a barrage!
A goblin with a shortbow. ^They can be trained with very low-cost, but that is all.
A goblin with a throwing spear. ^When he runs out of spears, he takes a wooden stick from somewhere and charge into enemies.^ The performance is also throwable. Bwahaha.
A goblin with a certain armor as a foot soldier. ^They can be pushed even more outnumbered now that they can't die from a single blow!
Do I need to explain with this name and cost?
A goblin that works. ^He is a fragile being, but he works hard to support the internal affairs of the city. We Goblins, we will follow you only!
A mad warrior of Orc who is very aggressive, but is easily attacked. ^...Many young Orc tribesmen, who have a tradition of Shobu, serve to prove their worth as warriors. ^The empire has often used them as disposable soldiers in their eagerness for merit. However, the cost of procuring armor for Orc men of large stature is prohibitive. ^Therefore, instead of armors, the empire provided them with a drug called "Mushrooms of the Madman,"^ thus wiping out their fear of death, and operating them as cheap and effective incision troops. ^By the way, the mushrooms are extremely addictive.
Heavily armed shield soldiers with assault skills that push up the battle line. ^They are slow, but hard and strong. ^...Orc and his men, who served as the imperial support force, took advantage of their large physique and stood in the front line with heavy armor. ^They were the pillars that supported the imperial line in battles in which mobile field forces did not participate, ^but unless they were mobilized for security, such battles were often lost battles. But such battles were often lost, unless they were mobilized for security reasons.
Heavily armed shield soldiers with assault skills to push up the battle line. ^They are slow on their feet but hard and strong. ^...The orcs who served as the imperial support force took advantage of their large stature and stood in the front line with heavy armor. ^They were the pillars that supported the imperial line in battles in which mobile field forces did not participate, ^but unless they were mobilized for security, such battles were often lost battles. But such battles were often lost, unless they were mobilized for security reasons, and the first casualties there were those who could not even escape because of the load of their equipment.
Extremely powerful Ork generals. Cheap for a hero unit. ^They also serve as flag-bearers. ^The reason why it is cheap can be seen in production. ^...The strongest and biggest guy in a group of Orc warriors can become one. ^He doesn't want to die at the hands of the enemy.
A regular Orc warrior. ^He has high attack speed. ^His true value is shown when he disperses.
A young man of the Orc tribe who is not yet recognized as a warrior. ^He has a unique high performance as a shield soldier who comes out from the beginning. ^On occasion, he does not bring a shield.
A goblin light cavalryman with tremendous swiftness and deployment speed. ^...As wolf cavalry, this is the original, and the Imperial Army only introduced wolf cavalry as scouts later. ^But sadly, they are completely outclassed in terms of equipment. But they are superior in terms of speed and cost, so let's overwhelm them with numbers.
Orc is still not recognized as a warrior even though he is old enough. ^He has a unique high performance for a shield soldier of this class. ^The problem lies in the fact that he cannot be upgraded any further.

A valuable cavalry hero unit with an inspiring effect. He is the only cavalryman who can use ^"Adrenaline Rush" and can be made to stand behind as a bow cavalryman by switching ^R skills. ^If you don't let them die in vain, they will show their lion's share of success. ^I heard that he has some other hidden abilities. ^... Bogatyr means "epic hero. They are the heroes of the North.
They are heavy cavalrymen who are very strong in head-on fistfights. ^In a word, they are mounted varyag. They are Bogatyri's companions. ^...In late antiquity, when the size of the garrison army, the Imperial Legion, had shrunk considerably, and ^ prompt relief by the Imperial Army was not so promising, defense was a matter of life and death for the cities located on the periphery. ^ The Luricia region was no exception, and the immigrated northerners were heavily employed as the SS of the leadership. After the southward advance of the Imperial Army, they fought not only against the greenskins from the east, but also against the Imperial Army, which was trying to prevent the independence of the cities on the periphery of the region.
A heavily-armed shield-carrying infantryman who can also attack at long range with his axe-throwing skills. ^He is very powerful, but he is slow to appear even though he is an infantryman. ^Mild version of JOMSVIKING.^...In the late Empire, northerners traveled up the rivers to various regions outside the western continent. ^Some of them settled in the continental East. ^Unlike their behavior in the west, in the eastern regions they acted mainly as merchants and mercenaries. ^ The northerners who settled on the continent on their own in this way were called ^varyag by the local people, and often used their prowess to gain power and wealth.
The most elite shield-carrying warriors of Lurikia. The quality of the heavy armor he wears is extremely high, and is no less than that of the heavy infantry of the empire. ^This performance infantry at this cost is, simply put, a threat.
A soldier who has just called in the lumberjacks. ^He can make ranged attacks with his great axe, but do not expect too much since he is half civilian.
A soldier who wields a two-handed long axe to cut through enemy lines. Thanks to the ^long axe, he can hit the enemy even from the rear. The ^armor has not changed much.
A mad warrior wielding a great axe. ^The mild version of Nord Berserk. ^He is still firepower-heavy, but he is faster than the top units, so depending on your tactics, you may want to stop his evolution here.
The two-handed soldiers of Rurikia, who finally wear proper armor. ^They literally cut through enemy lines with their bardiches, which can engulf even the rear ranks.
The old veteran soldiers of Lurikia. ^He has a very good cost performance.
The hunter of Luricia. ^He is now able to aim properly to some extent.
He has a flag that gives the buff effect "inspiration" to surrounding friendly units just by being there. ^The "Koumai" not only has a buff effect, but also has the ability to recover from defeat when it is given. ^This unit is essential for VERY HARD or higher.
A wizard who shoots cold arrows that have the effect of slowing down the opponent's movement speed. ^They increase mobility on snow, but they move in a unique way.
A werewolf mercenary who uses cold magic to spread debuffs over a wide area and DPS-oriented shooting. ^He moves faster on snow. ^He is also capable of pulling shots with his skills on his own. ^But considering the cost, it will be hard to get a number of them.

A half-human wizard who uses random attribute magic. ^... It is quite a bad situation to put apprentices who have not yet completed the regular process ^ on the front line. ......^ Since the loan system has been changed back to a benefit system regarding funds during the apprenticeship period, the cost is not cheap.
A demon warrior who draws his opponent with magic and reaps him with a scythe. ^... The fighting style of using a huge two-handed warscythe ^would be preserved for a long time among the demon tribes living in the Eastern realm even in later times. ^He, however, is at a loss to answer which part of the world is actually dark.
A super-elite magician in the service of the central imperial authority. ^He has unbelievable magical power, but it costs a tremendous amount of money to operate. ^He is not a hero unit despite this cost. ^... ^A talented sorcerer like them, trained in publicly funded educational institutions, ^was an extremely important factor in the domination of the empire. In the late antiquity, when the "elf flu" spread, a pandemic disease in which magic power was a risk factor for serious illnesses, ^ they were rarely seen in actual practice, and the gap between the field and the leadership was further widening. ^ They still often boast about their test scores from their time at the institute. ^The only way for them to relieve their stress in the midst of their abnormally hard work is to brag about their rank and the scores they got in the past. When they boast about their scores, I just say to them, "That's great!
Workers who have become nothing but bones. They work without saying a word, so their resource harvesting efficiency is high, but they are not suited for construction work. ^...Of course, they were once human beings. ^There are two types of immortal skeletons and demon-style bone golems, ^and although they are strictly speaking different, they are confused in the empire. ^ In the empire, the use of human corpses was customarily frowned upon. ^However, in late antiquity, as the birthrate declined and the slave labor force was depleted, ^landowners gradually began to put "these" to work on their plantations alongside poor peasants. Although many of the citizens of the empire questioned this, it was an undeniable fact that it was these "kore" who supported their livelihoods. In the late Empire, when the gap between the rich and the poor was widening, slaves and the poor had to work even to death. ^The secret is that they work quite lively in spite of the setting.
Human workers. Slaves and the poor in the imperial territory. ^They are just a little slower than the townspeople of other forces.
A healing chemomade yokai that heals the units around it. ^It has almost the same performance as the Maidragon, but it is a little faster on the snow.
A cavalryman who wields a sword covered in flames. ^He has an attack bonus against buildings and siege weapons. ^They are a good midshipman, but their cost is slightly high. ^Unlike some continent, he does not fire rockets from his bow.
A steppe cavalryman with lance-charging capability. ^She is quick but fragile. ^He also has a shield, so it is not impossible for him to fight a fistfight.
A step bow cavalryman. ^A great bow cavalryman that comes out in Sushi without research and automatically pulls and fires when instructed to scatter. ^On the other hand, his defense is low.

A step bow cavalryman. ^Its impeccable. ^Although he can't shoot an imperial mamluk.
A priestess who manipulates sword flashes and fire magic to block the use of her opponent's skills. ^... A priestess who serves in a temple in the Far East region, and who has adopted the power of evil herself in order to hunt evil things. ^They say that no evil spirits of mountains and rivers are unafraid of their swords, which seal out evil spirits. But I never heard of them being sent out on warfare. ......
A wizard who shoots flames incessantly. ^He moves slowly, but his firepower is high. ^He also has a modest recovery ability.
A fox with enormous magical power. A hero unit with a terrifying skill that seduces enemies and turns them into allies. ^He hates the word "echinococcus." ^... The fox tribe once lived an elegant life in the cities of civilization that flourished on the great plains of the Far East, taking advantage of their beauty and wits. In some lands, there have been many bloody dynastic changes over the ages. But no matter what changes of fate occurred, they always managed to slip into the upper echelons of the social hierarchy. ^ Even during the imperial invasion of the Far East, some of the foxes attempted to seduce and rather subdue the imperial soldiers. ^ However, what they turned on the people of the Far East and the foxes was not ^ respect for a different civilization or a passionate gaze at their beauty, but ^ only a sharp and cold blade of magical metal.

I am the sister of the Hero. ^I am sorry for the trouble my Oni-chan has caused you.







A goblin with experience as a foot soldier.^ It seems like a waste of resources to upgrade them to Tier 3, ^but they're a very subtle presence that can be used.
A lightly-armed sellsword that is strong against hero units.^She avoids melee attacks at a tremendous rate. ^ After the collapse of order in the Far East due to the empire's "Eastern Conquest",^there appeared many vagabonds who relied solely on their swords.^ Naturally, most of their fate were to fade away in battle field, but some of them were strong enough to cut down hundreds of enemies and still survive.
Extremely powerful shock cavalry. ^Undoubtedly the strongest of the regular cavalry units. ^... A convoy under the direct command of Khan. ^The nomads, who excelled in cavalry tactics, even defeated the imperial cataphracts with skillful disguised retreat tactics using the bow cavalry as a decoy.
Rurikian shield-carrying infantry. ^Overall stronger than human infantry of the same rank. ^They have exactly the same performance as the northern army soldiers.
The trained archers of Luricia. ^He is not much of an archer, but his strength is that he is sober and sturdy. ^Exactly the same performance as the Northern Selected Archers.
An elite magician who is proficient in several types of magic. ^The true value cannot be demonstrated without manual operation. ^He is competent to death but expensive to death. Because he is from a foreign company. ^...A dragon of the Nasun clan who studied magic in the empire. ^There are public baths and good wine in the empire, but ^this island is so backward that they are still happy to build statues like this. It's a terribly backward country, it's really embarrassing. I say this every day.

A crossbow dragon with a new weapon that has high suppression power instead of short flying distance. ^... Some of the Draco clansmen were trying to use the invented gunpowder to reproduce the ^ tremendously powerful weapons they had witnessed in their battles against the northerners. ^But it's hard to handle, you can't aim it properly, it's dangerous because it goes off easily, ^the bullets only send rocks and scrap metal flying in the area, ^and it's only powerful enough to tear apart a nearby human being, so it's a disappointing invention from the Dragon's point of view. It is a regrettable invention from the dragon's point of view.

A subtle shield soldier that receives a movement speed buff when not in combat. ^To put it bluntly, the performance is not worth the cost. ^But until the mobile field force is ready to mobilize, this is all that can be produced from the fort. ^...Reserve personnel extracted from the Imperial Frontier Defense Corps to the Mobile Field Force. ^In short, they are personnel to be counted. ^The Pseudo-Comitatenses are a fake mobile field force. ^Their existence itself may symbolize the confused military system at the end of the empire.
Magical creatures that float and look around. They have a slight ability to defend themselves. ^...Magical creatures modified by imperial magicians for early warning. ^Although the manufacturing process has long since been lost, there is no problem with it because it grew by itself in the sea while it was left unattended. ^It is a big problem from an ecological point of view.
A great crow with magical powers used by northerners. ^They use magic to release cold air and put their opponents in a state of panic. ^What kind of creature is this?
A long spearman with a long pike in his hand. ^Their performance is not so different from those of the lower tier, but if they are sent out in large numbers and form a line of spearheads, they will not allow their opponents to get close enough to them.

A Goblin with gunpowder weapon that has a short range but high suppression power. ^Its range is inferior to bows, but the knock back effect of shrapnel is remarkable. ^...Perhaps because they purchased handcannons sold by dragon peddlers to fill the shortage, ^their weapon seems to lack durability, and often brings unlucky fate to its shooter.
