# DIS Language System
  
## Rule
First of all, <span style="color: red; ">**DO NOT USE *,* COMMA IN DIS CSV FILE.**  </span>
  
Fileformat is strictly limited to utf-8.  
`^` means LF in DIS.  
`$;` will be replaced with `,` in the game.
`\v[n]` `\t[n]` will work as corresponding RM variable in the game (Exactly the same as RPGMaker default message system)  
`\c[n]` changes colour of all words after that token.  
### Attention
Language system of DIS will be slightly changed in very near future, with development of language manager written in java script.
