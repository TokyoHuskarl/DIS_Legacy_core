# DIS Language System
  
## Rule
First of all, <span style="color: red; ">**DO NOT USE *,* COMMA IN DIS CSV FILE.**  </span>
  
`^` means LF in DIS.  
`$;` will be replaced with `,` in the game.
`\v[n]` `\t[n]` will work as corresponding RM variable in the game (Exactly the same as RPGMaker default message system)  
`\c[n]` changes colour of all words after that token.
