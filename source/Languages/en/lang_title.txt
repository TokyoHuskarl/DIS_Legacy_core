Definitely not Roman Empire!
Definitely not Labarum!
Dra-san did nothing wrong.
It's almost harvesting season!
The time is here!
How could this happen?
Out of the ashes, a new day will dawn!
We know the walls will fall.
Dra-san, GYAO!
Der Kampf ums Recht!
SALVE!
SALVE?
Away with you vile beggar!
Less talking, more raiding!
My lord?
I will drink from your skull!
We all living in Empire, Empire ist wunderbar.
This is not a love song.
We all living in Empire, fine wine, sometimes war.
The Rtpian Antiquity is about to end!
But, Dra-san, how...
Wir trinken zusammen, nicht allein.
Was sollen wir denken, sieben Tage lang?
Was sollen wir denken, immerzu?
Doch stehen wir auf, um frei zu sein...
Also try Mountain Blade!
Also try Battle Brothers!
Also try AoE series!
Also try Frozen Triggers!
See what I see.
Back on Northern Shores!
War! Here to conquer! Battle ready! No retreat!
Warfare! Honour! Glory! Dra-san!
RAGNAROK awaits.
Muessen Wir endlich Recht und Ordnung schaffen?
I'm greater than Dra!
