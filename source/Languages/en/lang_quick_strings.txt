Objectives:^Destroy the Imperial City Senate in Niosia City, and then have Orthunass enter the ruins of it:^The hints for this map are extensive,^right-click to change the page.
Hint 1:^- The Imperial Army is weakened beyond comparison to before. If you're careful with the superior Imperial artillery, you shouldn't struggle in the early battle.^Especially the Imperial Border Guard - Limitanei - trying to prevent your army's river crossing, mainly consisting of irregular troops, is not a formidable opponent.^With careful movement and quick action, they shouldn't take long to deal with.^^-However, even if things go perfectly, a confrontation with the stationed Imperial IV Legion is inevitable.^The Legion, known as the strongest combat unit in the world, is incredibly powerful, even now in its weakened state.^There's no specific tactic that works well against the legionaries; you must face them head-on.^Always try to maintain numerical superiority against units named "Imperial Legion".^ Otherwise, your army may end up facing disastrous consequences.
Hint 2:^-You can hire Northmen mercenaries from the ship at the landing site on this map.^They join as initial forces, and they are a powerful asset that must be used effectively.^^-The Empire continues to weaken and even shows signs of splitting.^Their army is in the midst of downsizing due to financial issues.^The Legion that Orthunass feared can't even maintain its equipment,^and there's little coordination with newly established units.^A lightning-fast invasion can easily eliminate enemies outside the walls.^However, \c[5]still, the Empire is a far more formidable force compared to us.^Never allow a protracted battle.\c[0] Wasting time will not only allow local forces to regroup^but may also face formidable foes like the Imperial Mobile Field Army - Comitatenses - dispatched from the south,^or the Imperial Auxilia units from the eastern Imperial provinces.
Hint 3:^-There's a village of Potetons in the northwest.^The Imperial Legion is stationed there, but they're unprepared for your force's surprise landing, and initial defense is thin.^The Potetons have long been oppressed by the Empire; their cooperation may be possible if the Imperial forces are eliminated.^There seems to be a small gold mine in the forest near the village.^^-To the east is the famous Niosia gold mine.^If it can be captured, you won't run out of gold or stone.^But even in this age, the mine is always defended by the Imperial Legion.^As stated repeatedly, the Imperial Legion, though few number, is extremely powerful,^so half-hearted attempts to capture it should not be made.
Hint 4:^-Orthunass, the Empyrean Lord, can summon Drago Naskarls nearby with the R skill.^She can even send Naskarl over a thin wall.^Orthunass is a powerful wizard unit, and with enough SP, she can handle small forces single-handly.^Besides, she automatically buffs nearby dragon units.^ However, her combat ability is not too great to deal with anything.^The Empire recognizes the existence of the Empyrean Lord, leader of the dragons,^and will attack her relentlessly to hunt her down.^Letting her support troops is effective, but sending her to the front lines carries great risk, as her defeat is a condition for losing the game.^^-JOMSHERSIR is an incredibly strong unit, even when allied.^There's no penalty for him being defeated, but losing him carelessly will surely set back victory.^^-Enemy powerful wizards and flag bearers should be prioritized for removal with archers or catapults.^Especially the flag bearers, whose presence can significantly change the enemy's combat ability.

This map is almost the same as the classic one.^Enemies intermittently come from the eastern shore.^It's easy to understand the situation because of the one-way narrowness and fixed resource placement.^If it's your first play, it's recommended to start here.
This is a randomly generated map, except for the island's outline and initial placement.^You won't know where the enemies will land until you see the ships.^It's narrow and deploys quickly for light-heartedly playing.^However, it can be quite difficult in high difficulty levels due to the sight system.

Intercept the brave greenskin samourais and hordes of agile step cavalrymen. ^You may not have a hard time in the beginning of the battle once you realize their weaknesses.^Well, but...
The battle begins with skirmishes with weaker Limitanei and Auxiliary troops, ^but you can't be too careful in the early and middle game as they use a lot of siege weapons.^When the Comitatenses arrives, the enemy units will unbelievably get stronger. ^Get ready before their arrival.
Let's play with the most superior race in this world.^Gyaon gyaon! ^Well, the amount of troops is relatively small and they are not very good at using siege weapons, so you might be able to manage. ^But, of course, THOSE people will also come to meet you.

Do you really restart this stage?
\c[17]AD\c[0]-\c[17]Attack Damage^\c[0] Mainly affects the physical attack power of a weapon. ^Also related to the damage of physical attack skills. ^Note that it only represents the power of a single hit.
\c[16]AP\c[0]-\c[16]Ability Power^\c[0]Mainly affects the effectiveness of magic. ^Having higher AP means that your magic is more powerful. ^On the other hand, if the unit does not use magic, it is meaningless no matter how high it is.
\c[6]MR\c[0]-\c[6]Magic Registance^\c[0] Mainly relates to the reduction rate of magic attacks received. ^Unlike AR, it is not damaged by incoming attacks, but it does not cover HP.
\c[5]HIT\c[0]-\c[5]Hit Chance^\c[0] Mainly relates to the hit rate of physical attacks. ^No matter how high your unit's AD is, if HIT is low, its damage dealt will be patchy.
\c[3]EVA\c[0]-\c[3]Evasion^\c[0] Mainly related to the evasion rate against incoming physical attacks. ^The higher EVA is, the more survivable the unit is. ^However, having higher EVA is not that effective against ranged attacks unless your unit has a shield. ^Also, you cannot evade magical attacks.
 WILL\c[0]- Will^\c[0] Mainly related to morale and incoming mental attack check. ^The higher WILL is, the less likely you fail the morale check, that makes your unit flee, ^and the less likely your unit is affected by mental attacks.^ It does not have to be that high, but if it is extremely low, you will be in trouble in many situations.
\c[2]HP\c[0]-\c[2]Hit Point^\c[0]If your unit completely lost its HP, the unit dies. HP can be recovered by Healing skills or aura effects of the barracks. ^The humans of this world are so fragile that they die easily in battle - just as we do in our world. 
\c[3]AR\c[0]-\c[3]Armor^\c[0]AR primarily absorbs damage taken in lieu of HP. ^AR is also related to the reduction rate against physical attacks,^so the actual damage taken will be greater if AR is damaged.
\c[10]SP\c[0]-\c[10]Stamina Point^\c[0] Mainly relates to the cost of actions and movement speed(MS). ^When SP runs out, your unit will run out of breath, its movement speed will slow down and you won't be able to use your skills.^ Auto Attacks are still possible even if SP is out, but attack speed is halved so its DPS will certainly go down.
